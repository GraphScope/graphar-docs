What is GraphAr
------------------------

Graph processing serves as the essential building block for a diverse variety of real-world applications such as social network analytics, data mining, network routing, and scientific computing. As the graph processing becomes increasingly important, there are many in-memory and out-of-core graph storages, databases, graph computing systems and interactive graph query frameworks have emerged.

Targeting the fragmented graph processing ecology, **GraphAr (GAR)** is established to enable diverse graph applications or existing systems to build and access the graph data conveniently and efficiently. It specifies a standardized system-independent file format for graph and provides a set of interfaces to generate and access such formatted files.

GraphAr aims to serve as the standard file format for importing/exporting and persistent storage of the graph data for diverse existing systems, reducing the overhead when various systems co-work. It can also serve as the direct data source for graph processing applications.

The GraphAr project includes such topics as:

- Design of the standardized file format for graph data. (see `GraphAr File Format <file-format.html>`_)
- The C++ SDK library for reading and writing GAR files. (see `API Reference <../api-reference.html>`_)
- A set of Apache Spark tools for generating, loading and transforming GAR files. (coming soon)
- How to use GraphAr to write graph algorithms, or to work with existing systems such as GraphScope. (see `Application Cases <../applications/out-of-core.html>`_)

GraphAr Features
------------------------

The features of GraphAr include:

- It supports the property graphs and different representations for the graph structure (COO, CSR, CSC).
- It is compatible with existing widely-used file types, including CSV, ORC and Parquet.
- Apache Spark can be utilized to generate, load and transform the GAR files.
- It is convenient to be used by a variety of single-machine/distributed graph processing systems, databases, and other downstream computing tasks.
- It enables to modify the topology structure or the properties of the graph, or to construct a new graph with a set of selected vertices/edges.
